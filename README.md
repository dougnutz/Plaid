# Plaid
Plaid upload is a free ultra high speed file uploader, designed for large file transfer through the browser. This is based on investigations into moving large files through a browser in remote (high latency) connections. I discovered a few tricks along the way and want to capture them here. 
## this is a work in progress... stay tuned
